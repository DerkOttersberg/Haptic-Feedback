### Detailed Risk Mitigation Strategies  

**Internal Risks**  
- **Absence of Team Members**  
  Mitigation: Backup roles and cross-training ensure coverage for absent team members, minimizing delays.  

- **Insufficient Communication**  
  Mitigation: Daily stand-up meetings and collaborative tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams enhance project transparency and coordination.  

- **Tasks Not Completed on Time**  
  Mitigation: Use task tracking tools like **Trello** or **Jira** for better accountability, deadlines, and visibility across team tasks.  

- **Lack of Experience/Knowledge**  
  Mitigation: Provide on-the-job mentoring, workshops, and access to training materials for team members.  

- **Unrealistic Scheduling**  
  Mitigation: Establish realistic timelines and incorporate buffer periods to absorb unexpected delays.  

- **Technical Challenges in Software/Hardware Integration**  
  Mitigation: Conduct early prototyping, rigorous testing, and integrate features incrementally to reduce unforeseen challenges.  

---

**External Risks**  
- **Changing Requirements from Stakeholders**  
  Mitigation: Regular meetings, version-controlled requirement documents, and stakeholder sign-offs at each project milestone to prevent scope creep.  

- **Hardware Limitations**  
  Mitigation: Research and implement alternative hardware solutions that meet system performance requirements.  

- **Limited Access to Data**  
  Mitigation: Engage stakeholders early to negotiate access to data through partnerships, data-sharing agreements, or targeted purchases.  

- **Inability to Sufficiently Test**  
  Mitigation: Implement staged testing starting with smaller environments, gradually scaling up to realistic production settings.  

- **Drop-out of a Team Member**  
  Mitigation: Cross-train team members and maintain comprehensive project documentation to ensure continuity.

### Scoring Explanation  

- **Probability (1-5)**: Represents the likelihood of the risk occurring.  
  - 1 = Rare, 5 = Highly Likely  
- **Impact (1-5)**: Represents the severity of the risk's effect on the project.  
  - 1 = Minimal Impact, 5 = Critical Impact  
- **Risk Score**: Calculated as `Probability × Impact`. Higher scores indicate higher priority risks.  
- **Applied?**: Indicates whether the mitigation strategy has been implemented (✅ Yes, ❌ No).
