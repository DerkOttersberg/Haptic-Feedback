# Test Report: VR and Haptic Integration in an Extended Reality Environment

---

## Introduction

This **Test Report** outlines the results and observations from the testing of the **VR and Haptic Cloud Integration** project. The tests described in this document were executed to validate the systemâ€™s performance, functionality, and user experience under various conditions. 

The tests conducted were based on the **Test Plan**, which covered multiple areas, including **VR headset compatibility**, **remote rendering**, **network degradation simulation**, **data logging**, and **global connectivity**. Each test's conclusion is based on the success criteria defined in the **Test Plan**.

## Test 1: VR Headset Usage and Compatibility

### Test Results:
- Both the **Oculus Rift** and **HTC Vive** headsets were successfully connected to the system via **ALVR**.
- The VR application performed smoothly on both devices with no issues related to tracking, visual display, or performance.
  
### Conclusions:
- The system passed the test for VR headset compatibility, as both headsets worked as expected.
- The application remained responsive and showed no significant performance degradation. 
- **Success**: The application met the success criteria for headset compatibility.

## Test 2: Remote Rendering Implementation

### Test Results:
- When **ALVR** was disabled on the VR headset, the application continued rendering correctly on the laptop.
- The visuals were fluid, and there were no significant rendering artifacts or noticeable delays, as it was only rendering locally on the laptop.

### Conclusions:
- The remote rendering feature passed successfully.
- The system was able to run the VR experience smoothly on the laptop screen without the need for an active VR headset.
- **Success**: The remote rendering implementation met the success criteria.

## Test 3: Network Degradation Simulation

### Test Results:
1. **50ms Latency**:
   - The system ran smoothly without noticeable lag. Frame rate was maintained above **45 FPS**.
   - Input delay and haptic feedback were responsive with minimal delay.

2. **100ms Latency**:
   - The application was still usable with only minor delays in input and haptic feedback.
   - Frame rate remained above **45 FPS**, and input delay stayed below **100ms**.

3. **200ms Latency**:
   - The system exhibited noticeable lag, especially with haptic feedback.
   - Frame rate dropped slightly but remained above **30 FPS**.
   - Input delay was slightly higher, but **under 200ms**, meeting the success criteria.

### Conclusions:
- The system performed as expected across all latency scenarios.
- The frame rate remained playable, and input delays stayed within acceptable limits, even under **200ms** latency.
- **Success**: The system met the success criteria for network degradation simulation.

## Test 4: Performance Data Logging and Analysis

### Test Results:
- Performance data was successfully logged in the specified **JSON** format.
- The logs included frame rate, input delay, and haptic feedback accuracy, capturing degradation with increasing latency.
- Data analysis showed that frame rates dropped slightly with increased latency, but remained above **30 FPS** at **200ms** latency.

### Conclusions:
- Data was logged accurately, and the analysis matched expected trends observed during experimentation.
- The system's performance was logged in a way that facilitated easy graphing and analysis.
- **Success**: The data logging and analysis met the success criteria.

## Test 5: Global Connectivity (Multiple Users)
> **Note:** in this test session we could not get OpenVPN to work on the VR headset, instead PhoneVR was used to test the same theoretical functionality.
### Test Results:
- The user successfully connected to the VR system from two different locations using the same **VPN**.
- Interaction in the VR environment was smooth with minimal lag and no noticeable delays in synchronization.
- Audio and visual elements were synchronized, and no major issues with connectivity were encountered.

### Conclusions:
- The global connectivity test was successful, as the user was able to interact in the VR environment from different locations without significant latency.
- The system handled the connection between different locations efficiently, ensuring smooth interaction without major issues.
- **Success**: The global connectivity feature met the success criteria.

## Final Conclusion

All tests were successfully executed, and the system met the required success criteria for each test. The **VR and Haptic Cloud Integration** project demonstrates stable performance and functionality under varying conditions, including network latency, headset compatibility, remote rendering, and global user connectivity.

The results confirm that the application is ready for deployment in real-world scenarios, with high-quality performance even under degraded network conditions.
